	<p> 
		So, we’ll go no more a-roving<br> So, we’ll go no more a-roving
		So late into the night,<br> So late into the night,
		Though the heart be still as loving,<br> Though the heart be still as loving,
		And the moon be still as bright.<br> And the moon be still as bright.
		For the sword outwears its sheath,<br> For the sword outwears its sheath,
		And the soul wears out the breast,<br> And the soul wears out the breast,
		And the heart must pause to breathe,<br> And the heart must pause to breathe,
		And love itself have rest.<br> And love itself have rest.
		Though the night was made for loving,<br> Though the night was made for loving,
		And the day returns too soon,<br> And the day returns too soon,
		Yet we’ll go no more a-roving<br> Yet we’ll go no more a-roving
		By the light of the moon.<br> By the light of the moon.
